Johann Friedrich Agricola published his Introduction to the Art of Singing
in Germany in 1757. It brought to a German readership the 1723
treatise of the Italian singing teacher and castrato, Tosi, to which
Agricola added his own running commentary. The Introduction was recognized
as invaluable not only for teachers and their pupils but also
for advanced singers and professionals. Charles Burney, for example,
described it as "the best book on the subject in German," and hailed
the author as "the best singing master in Germany." This present edition,
translated with introduction and annotations by the celebrated
singer Julianne Baird, makes Agricola's work available for the first
time in English. Tosi's work was the first basic treatise on singing: it
codified important aesthetic principles and gave practical directions
for the singers of his time. Agricola, a pupil of J. S. Bach, addressed
the style of singing at the court of Frederick the Great and brought
Tosi's work up to date. His commentaries are so extensive that the
Introduction stands on its own as an important document in the history
of performance practice.
